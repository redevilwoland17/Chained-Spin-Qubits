**Engineering Long-Range Exchange Coupling and Sweet Spots in Multielectron Quantum Dots for Scalable Spin-Qubit Processors**

While often associated with a potential revolution in computing, quantum computers are increasingly researched to bring about an evolution of the current semiconductor industry. In particular, spin-based quantum computation has garnered significant attention due to its long coherence times and fast operation rates. However, realizing practical quantum algorithms necessitates the development of scalable qubit platforms.
This work explores the potential of multielectron quantum dots in achieving long-range exchange coupling and engineering sweet spots, crucial properties for developing two-dimensional quantum dot arrays. We employ a Python-based eigensolver to simulate a coupler-based three-quantum-dot chain containing two electrons. Our analysis of Rabi oscillations, induced by the system's exchange interaction, reveals that noise reduction and frequency control are attainable even with asymmetric electron tunnelling to the coupler. Furthermore, we report previously undiscovered natural sweet spots (conditions for stable qubit operation) in asymmetric systems.
In this poster, we present the methodology, results, and their implications, concluding with proposed future research directions. These insights contribute to the ongoing development of scalable spin-qubit processors, potentially bridging the gap between quantum computing theory and practical implementation.
